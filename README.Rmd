# tsfknn

The goal of tsfknn is to forecast time series using KNN regression.

## Installation

You can install tsfknn from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("franciscomartinezdelrio/tsfknn")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to forecast with tsfknn:

```{r example}
library(tsfknn)
pred <- knn_forecasting(USAccDeaths, h = 12, k = 3)
pred$prediction # To see a time series with the forecasts
plot(pred) # To see a plot with the forecast
library(ggplot2)
autoplot(pred, highlight = "neighbors")  # To see the nearest neighbors
```
